# RebbleOS

RebbleOS is an open-source reimplementation of the firmware for the devices
formerly manufactured by Pebble Technologies, Inc.  The firmware is based on
FreeRTOS, and aims to be binary-compatible with applications that were
written for the original Pebble OS, as well as radio-compatible with
smartphone applications that are designed to work with Pebble.

## Hacking

RebbleOS needs your help! This section discusses what you need to know to
get started working on the project.

### Building

RebbleOS currently can be built for `snowy` (Pebble Time and Pebble Time
Steel) and `tintin` (Pebble and Pebble Steel).  To build RebbleOS, follow
these steps:

* Obtain a checkout of the RebbleOS source code.
* Create a `localconfig.mk` if your cross-compiler is in an unusual location.  For instance, if you have the SDK installed in `/home/me`, add the following line to your `localconfig.mk`: `PEBBLE_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/home/me/Pebble/SDK/pebble-sdk-4.5-linux64/arm-cs-tools/bin`.  For more information on `localconfig.mk` variables, consult the `Makefile`.
* Build the firmware: `make`
* If you wish to run the firmware in `qemu`, copy the resources necessary into `Resources/`.  Take a look at [Utilities/mk_resources.sh](Utilities/mk_resources.sh) for more information on that.
* To run the firmware in `qemu`, try `make snowy_qemu`.

For example, the following builds RebbleOS on Debian Stretch:

    apt install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi
    git clone https://github.com/ginge/FreeRTOS-Pebble.git
    cd FreeRTOS-Pebble
    make

The Pebble SDK is a prerequisite for portions of RebbleOS. The
SDK is available at <https://developer.pebble.com/sdk/download/>. 
As an example, on Debian, one may create an installation
directory for the SDK using the following.

    mkdir ~/pebble-dev/
    cd ~/pebble-dev/
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.getpebble.com/pebble-tool/pebble-sdk-4.5-linux64.tar.bz2
    tar -jxf pebble-sdk-4.5-linux64.tar.bz2
    echo 'export PATH=~/pebble-dev/pebble-sdk-4.5-linux64/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
    . ~/.bash_profile
    sudo apt-get install python-pip python2.7-dev python-gevent
    sudo pip install virtualenv
    cd ~/pebble-dev/pebble-sdk-4.5-linux64
    virtualenv --no-site-packages .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    deactivate

The Pebble emulator requires the following libraries.
    
    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libfdt1 libpixman-1-0


If you wish to build firmware to run on your device, you may also wish to
consider a script like [buildfw.sh](buildfw.sh).  Running RebbleOS on hardware is
currently out of scope for this document.

### Code structure

_(This section is, admittedly, somewhat aspirational.  Do not be surprised
if code within RebbleOS does not necessarily conform to this structure
yet!)_

RebbleOS is composed of four major components: the hardware abstraction
layer, the core operating system, the PebbleOS compatibility layer, and
system applications.  We break down these components as follows:

* **Hardware abstraction layer.**  This subsystem provides a unified
  interface for the rest of the system, and abstracts away platform-specific
  elements.  The HAL lives in the directory `hw/`; symbols that the HAL
  exports to the rest of the system are prefixed with `hw_`.  The main
  entity that the HAL works on is a _"platform"_; for an example, take a
  look at [hw/platform/snowy/config.mk](hw/platform/snowy/config.mk).  A platform depends on various chip
  components, and potentially other driver components; it exports a
  [platform.h](hw/platform/snowy/platform.h) that includes all defines that the rest of the system may
  need.  The HAL is, in theory, independent of the rest of the OS; it does
  not call into the rest of the system other than through debugging
  mechanisms and through callbacks that it is provided.

* **Core OS.** This subsystem provides basic services that any smartwatch
  OS, even if not implementing a Pebble-like API, might need.  HAL accesses
  are marshalled through concurrency protection; higher-level power
  management takes place; and, flash wear leveling and filesystem management
  happens in the core OS.  The core OS lives in `rcore/`, and symbols
  exported from the core OS are prefixed with `rcore_`.  It calls on
  FreeRTOS, which lives in `FreeRTOS/`.

* **Pebble compatibility layer.**  The core OS provides basic isolation
  between threads and framebuffer management primitives, but the Pebble
  compatibility layer provides higher level operations, like Pebble-style
  layers, input management and routing, and UI services.  The Pebble
  compatibility layer lives in `rwatch/`, and symbols exported from it are
  prefixed with `rwatch_`.  (Functions that are exactly analogous to Pebble
  APIs may be named with their exact name.)

* **System applications.** We'll, uh, get there when we have some.  Yeah.
