A fast, open-source graphics library for Pebble mimicking the current API.

## What?

Pretty much a complete replacement for Pebble's
[graphics routines.](https://developer.pebble.com/docs/c/Graphics/)

We're not there _yet_. We will be soon enough.

## Why?

Further software development for Pebble is going to need open-source libraries.

## Who?

Hi! It's me, @jneubrand. If you'd like to help out, contact me via Pebble's
Discord server.

Special Thanks:
- @pschafhalter for helping with some optimization
