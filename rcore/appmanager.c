/*
    Heres what is going down. We are going to load the app from flash.
    The app is stored in flash and is a butchered ELF position independant
    compiled (-fPIC) library. It's layout is as so:
    
     | AppicationHeader | App Binary (.text) | Data Section (.data) | Global offset  | BSS [and reloc table] |
        
    There is a symbol table in each Pebble app that needs to have the address 
    of _our_ symbol table poked into it. 
    The symbol table is a big lookup table of pointer functions. 
    When an app calls a function such as window_create() it actually turns 
    that into an integer id in the app.
    When the app calls the function, it does 
      function => id => RebbleOS => id to function => call
    This allows the app to do a lookup of a function id internally, check 
    it in our rebble sym table, and return a pointer address to to the function 
    to jump to.
    
    We also have to take care of BSS section. This is virtual size - app size
    BSS. is always zeroed.
    
    Then relocate entries. Each Pebble app is compiled with 
    Position Independant code (PIC) that means it can run from any address.
    This is usually used on dlls .so files and the like, and a Pebble app 
    is no different. It is the responsibility of the dynamic loader 
    (us in this case) to get the list of relocations (which is at the end of 
    the binary) and "patch" or relocate all of the data symbols in the 
    application binary.
    
    (see)
    http://grantcurell.com/2015/09/21/what-is-the-symbol-table-and-what-is-the-global-offset-table/
    
    When the app executes, any variables stored in the global are looked up...
    int global_a;
    printf(global_a);
    > go to the GOT in the DATA section by relative address and get the address of global_a
    > go to the address of global_a in data section
    > this is the allocated memory for globals
    > retrieve value
    
    NOTE: once we have relocated, we don't need the loaded header GOT any more, so we can delete it
    in fact the bss section will zero over it.
    
    For now, the statically allocated memory for the app task is also used
    to load the application into. The application needs uint8 size to execute 
    from, while the stack is uint32.
    Each app is given its own stack, while the heap is shared between the app
    binary and the app memory
    
    We are leaning on Rtos here to actually spawn the app with it's own stack
    (cheap fork)  and make sure the (M)SP is set accordingly. 
    As a bonus we can manipulate this task in FreeRTOS directly through it's 
    TCB handle (suspen, kill, delete)
    
    Steps:
    * Find app on flash
    * Load app into lower stack
    * Set symbol table address
    * load relocs and reloc the GOT + DATA
    * zero BSS
    * fork
